This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Testing

First, run cypress:

```bash
npm run cypress
```

When Cypress loads in your browser select E2E Testing and select a browser.

You should then see a `cypress/e2e` directory with two tests `home.cy.ts` and `ux.cy.ts`.

Selecting one of these will open the test suite and automatically run them.
